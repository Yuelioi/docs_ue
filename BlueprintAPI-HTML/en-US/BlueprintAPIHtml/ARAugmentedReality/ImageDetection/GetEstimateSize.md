# GetEstimateSize

  *   * Note that ARCore can return a valid estimate size of the detected image when the tracking state of the UARTrackedImage

  * is tracking. The size should reflect the actual size of the image target, which could be different than the input physical

  *   * ARKit will return the physical size of the ARCandidate image.





Target is ARTracked Image

## Inputs

Target: ARTracked Image Object Reference.  

## Outputs

Return Value: Vector 2D Structure. Note that ARCore can return a valid estimate size of the detected image when the tracking state of the UARTrackedImage: is tracking. The size should reflect the actual size of the image target, which could be different than the input physical: ARKit will return the physical size of the ARCandidate image..
