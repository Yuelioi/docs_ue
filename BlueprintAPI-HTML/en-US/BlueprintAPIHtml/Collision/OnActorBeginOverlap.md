# OnActorBeginOverlap

On Actor Begin Overlap:. Called when another actor begins to overlap this actor, for example a player walking into a trigger.. For events when objects have a blocking collision, for example a player hitting a wall, see 'Hit' events.

Components on both this and the other Actor must have bGenerateOverlapEvents set to true to generate overlap events.
