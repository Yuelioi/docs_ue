# AddConstructionField

AddConstructionField. This function will dispatch a command to the physics thread to apply. a generic evaluation of a user defined field network. This command will be used in a. construction script to setup some particles properties (anchors...). See documentation,. for examples of how to recreate variations of the above generic. fields using field networks
