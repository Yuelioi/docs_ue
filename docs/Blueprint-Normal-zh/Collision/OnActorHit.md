# OnActorHit

On an actor being hit:. Called when this actor hits (or is hit by) something solid. This can happen as a result of the actor moving, using a Set Position with Scan enabled, or a physics simulation. For events where objects overlap (for example, walking onto a trigger), see Overlap events.

For crash events generated by collisions during physics simulations, "Simulation generates crash events" must be enabled.
