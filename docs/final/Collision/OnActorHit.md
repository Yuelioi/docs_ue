# OnActorHit

On an actor being hit:. Called when this actor hits (or is hit by) something solid. This can happen as a result of the actor moving, using a Set Position with Scan enabled, or a physics simulation. For events where objects overlap (for example, walking onto a trigger), see Overlap events.

For crash events generated by collisions during physics simulations, "Simulation generates crash events" must be enabled.

On Actor Hit:. Called when this Actor hits (or is hit by) something solid. This could happen due to things like Character movement, using Set Location with 'sweep' enabled, or physics simulation.. For events when objects overlap (e.g. walking into a trigger) see the 'Overlap' event.

For collisions during physics simulation to generate hit events, 'Simulation Generates Hit Events' must be enabled.
